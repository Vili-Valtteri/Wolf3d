# Wolf3D

Wolf3D is a project that explores the world of computer graphics by creating a first-person shooter game with a custom engine. In this game, you navigate through a maze-like environment and fight off enemy AI using a gun. Unlike other 3D games, this project uses a ray-casting technique to create the illusion of 3D graphics.

## Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler
- macOS based operating system
